# BetterFileImporter

## What does this Package do?
Simple! It adds a new view modifier, very similar to .fileImporter, that lets you pick files.
The cool part? It even works with enterprise certificates, like the ones from [WSF](https://wsfteam.xyz).

And it keeps things super straightforward:
You get an array of URLs. Thatâ€™s it.
No more result.get() nonsense just to access your files!

## Installation
### Using Xcode's built-in Package Manager 
Go to File > Add Package Dependencies...

then, in the Search-Bar enter: 

```https://github.com/timi2506/BetterFileImporter.git``` 

and press "Add Package" and make sure to link it to your target.
